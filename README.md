# Air-Cargo-Analysis
An SQL project handling datasets on air cargo information

This project uses data from an aviation company which contain details about various flights and the customers who go on them. I created a database called air_cargo in MySQL workbench to manage the 4 data tables provided for the assignment. The tables were named “customer” which contains information about customers, “passengers_on_flights” which contains information about travel details, “ticket_details” which contains information about the tickets, and “routes” which contains information about the routes taken by the flights. Using these 4 datasets I first created an entity relationship diagram between them, using the customer IDs and route IDs as primary keys and linking them to corresponding foreign keys. For the rest of the project, I made a series of queries that allowed me to gather insights on the data. To name a few, I identified all the passengers and the revenue generated from business class flights, I identified the first and last name of every passenger that has flown on Emirates, and I calculated the total price of all tickets booked by individual customers across different aircraft IDs. Several queries were also saved as stored procedures.
